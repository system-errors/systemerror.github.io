        <h2>MANIFESTO</h2>
        <p><strong>SYSTEM ERROR</strong> is a new kind of truth inspired by Gonzo journalism and street art. It forces you to think differently and confront the world around you. It isn't for the rich, the powerful, or those who build empires. It's for those who ask the hard questions, tear things apart, see through the cracks in the system, and smile because they know the truth.</p>
        <p>You will find these logs on the streets, pasted on walls and signs. They cover today's themes, such as the rise of oligarchies, endless war, tech dystopia, and climate collapse. The system is erroring, and they want us to be compliant.</p>
        <p>All logs come from <strong>SYSTEM ERROR</strong>.</p>
        <p>Interpret it at your own risk—or don't. But remember, the choice was never really yours to begin with.</p>

        <h2>Syslogs</h2>
        A log of system errors. Read them, share them, ignore them—it doesn't matter.
